<h1>Embedded Web Server</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>EWS is a web server construction kit, designed for embedded
applications using the GNAT Ada compiler.

<p>The project is hosted
on <a href="https://github.com/simonjwright/ews">Github</a>.

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>EWS requires GNAT (GNAT GPL 2012 or later, FSF GCC 4.8.0 or later)
and XML/Ada. GNAT GPL 2013 (and, hopefully, later) includes XML/Ada;
earlier versions supply XML/Ada as source which has to be built and
installed.

<p>In the EWS distribution's top-level directory, <tt>make</tt> will
build the library, and
<tt>make demo</tt> will create a server <tt>doc/ews_demo</tt>, which
when executed will listen on port 8080 and respond with the web in
the <tt>doc/</tt> directory.

<p>The package can be installed with the compiler by <tt>make
install</tt> (more likely, <tt>sudo make install</tt>). You can
install in an alternative place by setting <tt>prefix</tt>, for
example

<pre>
   $ make install prefix=~/local/ews
</pre>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>The facilities available in EWS, and the code for the
demonstration, are described in <a href="ews.pdf">this document</a>,
which also acts as the source code using
the <a href="http://www.literateprogramming.com/">Literate
Programming</a> facilities
of <a href="https://github.com/simonjwright/nuweb.py">nuweb.py</a>.
